# **Project Name: Pet Adoption**

**Description**:  Pet Adoption is a web application designed to connect potential pet adopters with available animals. The platform allows users to adopt pets based on various criteria such as type, breed, age, gender, and price.


## 5 Key Features
  **1. Pet Listings and Profiles:**
  Display detailed profiles for each adoptable pet, including information like breed, age, gender, vaccination status, details information and adoption fee. Users can view high-quality images of the pets.

  **2. Filtering:**
  Allow users to easily Filter for pets based on pets name like: dog, cat, Rabbit and Bird. Filters help users narrow down their options to find the perfect pet.

  **3. Adoption Application:**
  Users can submit an adoption application directly through the adopt button.

  **4. Like Button (Pet Favoriting):**
  Users can "like" or "favorite" pets by clicking the like button on each pet profile. This allows users to keep track of the pets they are interested in without starting the adoption process right away.

  **5. Sort by Price:**
  Users can sort the pet listings by price to help them find pets within their budget more easily. This feature enhances the browsing experience by making it easier to prioritize adoption fees.
